Implementation
  Parallelization
    Provides utilities for acquiring loops to parallelize, populating
    data structures used by parallelization techniques, and linking
    parallelized versions of a loop to the original function

  SCCDAGAttrs
    An ad-hoc collection of data structures and helpers that characterize
    SCC by several criteria:
      Whether the SCC is Independent, Reducable, or Sequential
      Whether the SCC is clonable
      Whether the SCC is composed solely of an IV (induction variable)
        Whether that IV is "simple", a single PHI, accumulator, and branch

    NOTE: These analyses of SCC should be formalized and separated out

  SCCDAGPartition
    A set of helpers for describing subsets (sets of SCCs) of the loop's
    SCCDAG. Helpers include:
      Adding, removing, and merging subsets
      Checking whether a merge is valid
      Checking post-merge if no cycles exist
      Removing cycles by means of further merging
